It is a dark and stormy knight. Wait a minute, that's not right. Well, it is, indeed a dark night, and you are lying in your bedroom, thinking about tomorrow. Tomorrow is your Final, you see? And if you fail it, then it is Goodbye, Engineering, and Hello, Burger Flipping. You ponder over your life. It seems too mundane. Too simple for your comfort. You are lost in your thoughts when you hear a small crash in the lounge outside.
*You Get Up and check the source of the noise*
You Decide to get up and check where this noise is coming from. The lounge is neat and tidy. You see nothing that might have crashed.
*Check the time*
You look at your watch. Damn it. It's 4 am already?
