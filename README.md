# Evolution

## Introduction
"Evolution" is the tentative title of a game that I am writing for
the Ludum Dare 24 Game making competition. The Game is intended to
be a Text adventure, similar in spirit to the old Choose Your Own
Adventure (CYOA) books. I hope you people enjoy it.

## Technologies In Use
I am using the "undum" javascript game library, which is Open
Source. The source is available at
